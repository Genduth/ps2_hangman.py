# Hangman Game – MIT 6.0001 Inspired Project

This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic Hangman game, developed as part of a programming exercise inspired by the MIT 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming course.

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- **`ps2_hangman.py`**  
  The main implementation of the Hangman game. This file includes all the core logic for running the game, handling user input, tracking guesses, and displaying game progress.

- **`ps2_hangman_test.py`**  
  A test suite for validating the functionality of `ps2_hangman.py`. It includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual functions and overall game behavior.

- **`hangman_example.py`**  
  An example implementation provided by the MIT 6.0001 course. This file serves as a reference and learning aid for understanding how a Hangman game can be structured in Python.

## ▶️ How to Run

To play the game:

```bash
python ps2_hangman.py
